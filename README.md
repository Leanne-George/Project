*Project Title*

The piano is a majestic instrument that effortlessly blends elegance and emotion. Whether it's the subtle melodies born out of gentle keystrokes or carefully crafted harmonies that exude the grandeur of music, the piano is the medium that connects us to the world of music. Most of classical and modern music is composed on the piano. Although this instrument was mastered by greats like Beethoven and Mozart who dedicated their lives to studying it, anyone can learn to play simple melodies and even write music of their own!
And that's exactly why 

And therefore, my teammate and I have made a compact piano for everyone to understand the true potential at a free cost and an easier accessibility.
