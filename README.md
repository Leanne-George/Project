Mozart's Musical Machine

The piano is a majestic instrument that effortlessly blends elegance and emotion. Whether it's the subtle melodies born out of gentle keystrokes or carefully crafted harmonies that exude the grandeur of music, the piano is the medium that connects us to the world of music. Most of classical and modern music is composed on the piano. Although this instrument was mastered by greats like Beethoven and Mozart who dedicated their lives to studying it, anyone can learn to play simple melodies and even write music of their own!

And therefore, my teammate and I have made a compact piano for everyone to understand the true potential of music making at a free cost with easier accessibility. Our main goal with this website was to encourage people to try out playing a virtual piano with no pressure at all about producing well crafted melodies. By naming it, "Mozart's Musical Machine", we wanted to highlight the fun and somewhat goofy side of playing the piano which, in the general sense, is considered a sophisticated but serious instrument.

The UI/UX was designed keeping the same goal in mind with warm, welcoming tones and background. The sounds imported are of the original grand piano. 
Our future goals with this project is to implement a backend where the users could store their composed music and sounds. We also wish to expand the range of the sounds produced to make it a virtual, handy piano-cum-keyboard.

In order to use this website, all you've got to do is to run the html file and then play the notes with either the mouse or the keyboard. Yes, it's that simple!
We hope our project will prove to be useful for not just music lovers but the general public as well. So here's to more fun, relaxed music making!
